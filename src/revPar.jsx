      California's reservoirs are part of a <a href="https://www.ppic.org/wp-content/uploads/californias-water-storing-water-november-2018.pdf">complex water storage system</a>.  The State has very variable weather, both seasonally and from year-to-year, so storage and water management is essential.  Natural features - the Sierra snowpack and vast underground aquifers - provide more storage capacity,  but reservoirs are the part of the system that people control on a day-to-day basis.  Managing the flow of surface water through rivers and aqueducts, mostly from North to South, reduces flooding and attempts to provide a steady flow of water to cities and farms, and to maintain natural riparian habitats.  Ideally, it also transfers some water from the seasonal snowpack into long-term underground storage.  Finally, hydro-power from the many dams provides carbon-free electricity.

California's water managers monitor the reservoirs carefully, and the state publishes daily data on reservoir storage.
